## Unix Commands in Windows

>Implement a UNIX experience into Windows

This repo contains a collection of custom Windows commands to mimic a unix environment.

Add this folder to the Windows Path:
1. Clone this repository to a perminent location on your computer
2. Go to "System Properties", "Advanced", then "Environment Variables..."
4. Under "User variables for <user>" find and click "Path"
5. Click "Edit..." then "New"

## Other notes
I reccommend installing **oh-my-posh** and **clink** for a better experience.

My personal "oh-my-posh.lua" can be found here: https://github.com/YelloNox/oh-my-posh-config

Clink will add the ```history``` command to your terminal.
